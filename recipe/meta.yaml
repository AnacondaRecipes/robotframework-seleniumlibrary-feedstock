  summary: Web testing library for Robot Framework

  description: |
    SeleniumLibrary is a web testing library for Robot Framework that utilizes
    the Selenium tool internally. The project is hosted on GitHub and downloads
    can be found from PyPI.

    SeleniumLibrary works with Selenium 3 and 4. It supports Python 2.7 as well
    as Python 3.6 or newer. In addition to the normal Python interpreter, it works
    also with PyPy and Jython. Unfortunately Selenium is not currently supported
    by IronPython and thus this library does not work with IronPython either.
